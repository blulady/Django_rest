# Django_rest
an api created with the Django Rest Framework

Here I have followed the tutorial from https://www.django-rest-framework.org/ to learn how to create an api. Here I learned how to make `Serializers`, define their fields by using Django Rest Framework's Serializers class ```HyperlinkedModelSerializer``` and Meta Class (this was my introduction to the Meta Class and type). I made use of Django's class based views and Django Rest Framework decorators to include the Serializers I made and DRF's ```Permissions``` to handle authentication and throttling.
